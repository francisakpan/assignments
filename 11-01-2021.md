# & - Operator in Kotlin

Kotlin **does not** support the single '&' - operator or any other special character for bitwise operations.
Kotlin instead uses the following infix functions for bitwise operations. They are:
 - shl(bits) – signed shift left
 - shr(bits) – signed shift right
 - ushr(bits) – unsigned shift right
 - and(bits) – bitwise and
 - or(bits) – bitwise or
 - xor(bits) – bitwise xor
 - inv() – bitwise inversion
