# 2. Difference and similarities between Actiivity lifecycle and Fragment lifecycle

Activity is the UI of an application through which user can interact with the application. Fragment is part of an Activity. 
It may also be considered as a sub-Activity inside an activity which has its own Life Cycle and runs parallel to the Activity Life Cycle.  
Because a Fragment is always hosted by an Activity, the Fragment lifecycle is directly affected by the host Activity lifecycle. 
For example, when the Activity is paused, so are all Fragments in it, and when the Activity is destroyed, so are all Fragments.

## The table below shows how the frament callback functions are broken down and their similiarities with the activity lifecycle states.

|Activity State	| Fragment Callbacks Triggered	| Fragment Lifecycle |
|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
|Created | onAttach(), onCreate(), onCreateView(), onViewCreated() | Fragment is added and its layout is inflated.|
|Started | onStart() |	Fragment is active and visible.|
|Resumed | onResume() |	Fragment is active and ready for user interaction.|
|Paused |	onPause()	| Fragment is paused because the Activity is paused.|
|Stopped | onStop()	| Fragment is stopped and no longer visible.|
|Destroyed | onDestroyView(), onDestroy(), onDetach()	| Fragment is destroyed.|
