# 1. The Activity states called when orientation changes
 - onPause
 - onStop
 - onCreate
 - onStart
 - onResume
 

# 2. Difference and similarities between Actiivity lifecycle and Fragment lifecycle

Activity is the UI of an application through which user can interact and Fragment is the part of the ActivityIt is a sub-Activity inside an activity which has its own Life Cycle and runs parallel to the Activity Life Cycle.

## The table below shows how the frament callback functions are broken down and their similiarities with the activity lifecycle states.

|Activity State	| Fragment Callbacks Triggered	| Fragment Lifecycle |
|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
|Created | onAttach(), onCreate(), onCreateView(), onViewCreated() | Fragment is added and its layout is inflated.|
|Started | onStart() |	Fragment is active and visible.|
|Resumed | onResume() |	Fragment is active and ready for user interaction.|
|Paused |	onPause()	| Fragment is paused because the Activity is paused.|
|Stopped | onStop()	| Fragment is stopped and no longer visible.|
|Destroyed | onDestroyView(), onDestroy(), onDetach()	| Fragment is destroyed.|
