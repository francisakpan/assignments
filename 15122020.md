# LateInit vs Lazy

| Lazy | LateInit |
|------|----------|
| `lazy { ... }`, defines the only initializer for the property, which can be altered only by overriding the property in a subclass. | `lateinit var` can be initialized from anywhere the object is seen from, e.g. from inside a framework code, and multiple initialization scenarios are possible for different objects of a single class. |

If you want your property to be initialized from outside in a way probably unknown beforehand, use `lateinit`.

# Var vs Val

`var` is like a general variable and can be assigned multiple times and is known as the mutable variable in Kotlin. Whereas `val` is a constant variable and can not be assigned multiple times and can be Initialized only single time and is known as the immutable variable in Kotlin.
